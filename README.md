# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python

This repository provides instructional material for 
machine learning in python.  The material is used for two classes taught at NYU Tandon
by [Sundeep Rangan](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/):

* EE-UY / CS-UY 4563: Introduction to Machine Learning (Undergraduate)
* EL-GY 9123: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate)

Anyone is free to use and copy this material (at their own risk!).  

## Pre-requisites

* All the software can be run on any laptop (Windows, MAC or UNIX).
Instructions(./GCP/getting_started.md)
are also provided to run the code in Google Cloud Platform on a virtual machine (VM).
* Both classes assume no python or ML experience.  However, experience
with some programming language (preferably object-oriented) is required.
* To follow all the mathematical details and to complete the homework exercises,
the class assumes undergraduate probability, linear algebra and multi-variable calculus.

## Start the course
